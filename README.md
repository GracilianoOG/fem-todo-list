## 📖 Description

A sleek and interactive todo list application built as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge. Users can easily create, filter, and delete tasks. Reorder your todos with simple drag-and-drop functionality. Developed using React JS and styled-components for a clean and component-based styling approach.

This project provided a great opportunity to practice with custom hooks and the context API. Creating a drag-and-drop system from scratch was a challenging and enjoyable experience to me, as it was the first time I've interacted with the API.
